# Waste Digital Twin Research Script

This script is related to the Waste Digital Twin research conducted by Iván Cárdenas as part of his MSc thesis at the University of Twente. The script is designed to simulate waste collection and management processes using a digital twin approach.

## Script Overview

The script is written in Python and utilizes ArcGIS tools to model and simulate waste collection and management scenarios. The script performs the following main tasks:

1. Imports necessary libraries and initializes the ArcGIS environment.
2. Creates a road network and network dataset for waste collection using the ArcGIS Network Analyst extension.
3. Defines functions for vehicle routing problem (VRP) analysis, resetting values, generating random waste values, and cleaning up waste data.
4. Retrieves layers from ArcGIS Online that are used in the analysis, such as container locations, landfill entrance, road network, route definitions, and renewal conditions.
5. Executes the simulation process by iterating over specified time intervals.
6. Generates random waste quantities, performs VRP analysis for route optimization, and cleans up waste data.
7. Outputs the results in route and orders feature classes.

## Script Execution

To execute the script, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that the necessary libraries and ArcGIS environment are set up.
2. Obtain required layer URLs from ArcGIS Online for container locations, landfill entrance, road network, route definitions, and renewal conditions.
3. Specify the number of iterations to simulate waste collection.
4. The script creates a network dataset and performs waste collection simulation based on the specified iterations.

Please note that the script assumes access to the ArcGIS Network Analyst extension and ArcGIS Online resources for data layers.
